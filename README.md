# Networking Labs Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on networking labs using Cisco Packet Tracer and virtualized environments.  

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in networking fundamentals while developing practical troubleshooting skills aligned with real-world IT Support and Network Engineering roles.

Each lab includes:
- Topology diagram
- Configuration details
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting scenarios
- Key technical takeaways

This repository will grow progressively as I advance through networking concepts.

## Progress Philosophy

Each lab is built with the following structure:

1. Design the topology
2. Configure devices
3. Verify connectivity
4. Intentionally break the network
5. Troubleshoot and document findings

The focus is not just configuration, but understanding *why* networks behave the way they do.
